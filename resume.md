 Summary
 Hello there!
 I'm a final-year Computer Science and Business Management
 student passionate about building impactful, scalable software
 solutions that drive real-world value.
 I specialize in .NET-based development and full-stack web
 applications, with growing experience in cloud and data engineering.
 I'm currently preparing for full-time Software Developer roles starting
 January 2026.
 Currently, I work as a Web Designer at the University of Lethbridge,
 collaborating with Jaime Takahashi to redesign the Student Success
 Centre website, making resources more accessible and student
friendly.
 Previously, I completed:- A Systems Developer Internship at CNRL, where I built internal
 tools using C#, Blazor, Azure DevOps, and SQL to improve data
 accuracy and streamline workflows.- An 8-month SWE Internship at Arcurve Inc., where I worked on full
stack, client-facing apps, optimized backend systems, and integrated
 CI/CD pipelines within agile teams.
 In addition to technical roles, I served as a Co-op Ambassador
 at the University of Lethbridge, mentoring students on resumes,
 networking, and career readiness, which strengthened my
 communication and leadership skills.
